# E1E2 BAR Proteomic Analysis
This repository contains the data and code to accompany "Enhanced Production of HCV E1E2 Subunit Vaccine Candidates via Protein-Protein Interaction Identification in Glycoengineered CHO cells (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.12.659199v1.abstract) by Wu et al.

# This Repository includes:
1) Proteomic analysis ofthe E1E2 BAR proteomic dataset in R using the DEP package.
2) Transcriptomic analysis of the E1E2 RNA-Seq dataset using the DeSeq2 package.

# Datasets
The Bar and RNA-Seq file used to perform the analysis is included in this repository.
